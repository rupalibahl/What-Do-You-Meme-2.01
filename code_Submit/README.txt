Project Description:\
\
The What Do You Meme? App is an iOS application that simulates a mobile version of the multiplayer What Do You Meme? card game. This game is essentially based on the concept of Cards Against Humanity, but with photos of memes instead of cards with fill in the blanks or questions, with a judge selecting a winning caption card that is the funniest, in relation to the meme. We created this app using a React Native front end, Java backend, and MySQL database.\
\
\
Download:\
\
In order to run this project on your local machine, download the WhatDoYouMeme201.zip file and unzip. This will contain the java files and jars needed to run the server and servlet (in this order) on Eclipse. It will also contain all the front end files necessary. Ensure that your MySQL Database is running. Copy paste the MySQL query and run it to establish your database structure before running the app. (Note: If you do not have Node.js, the react-native files, or the most recent version of Xcode on your machine, please download these before running).\
\
Steps to run:\
\
Run the Gameserver.java file on your server, followed by the servlet on your server. Then, open your terminal and open the WhatDoYouMeme201 folder. In your command line, write npm start. After the packager begins, press \'91i\'92 to start the iPhone X simulator. Once this opens, select hardware->Devices to open two more players, because the game requires at least 3. Now you are ready to sign in or sign up and play the game.\
